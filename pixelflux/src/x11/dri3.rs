//! DRI3 zero-copy X11 capture: the X server blits the screen into GPU buffers this process
//! allocated, and the hardware encoder reads them where they lie.
//!
//! It serves a server whose screen lives on the GPU (XLibre's Xvfb with glamor, an Xorg on a
//! DRM driver), where the XShm path in [`super`] would read the screen back into host memory
//! for the hardware session to upload again. A small pool of dmabufs is allocated through GBM
//! on the render node the server draws with, each is wrapped in an X pixmap
//! (`PixmapFromBuffers`), and every frame is one `CopyArea` from the root window into the next
//! pixmap, which glamor runs as a GPU-to-GPU blit. The encoder then imports the dmabuf in place,
//! through the same [`FrameEncoder::encode_dmabuf`] the Wayland zero-copy path uses, so a frame
//! is never touched by the CPU between the screen and the bitstream.
//!
//! Completion is waited for with a one-pixel `GetImage` of the destination pixmap: the server
//! answers only after the blit it ordered before has landed, so the encoder never reads a
//! half-copied frame, and no fence object or implicit-sync assumption is involved.
//!
//! Nothing here reads pixels, so what stands in for the XShm path's per-stripe content hashing is
//! the Damage extension on the root window: the server's report is both what says a frame is worth
//! encoding and what ends the wait for one, within the pacing [`crate::pace`] keeps, so a change is
//! published as it lands rather than on the next tick. The XFixes cursor is composited by the
//! server through Render, on the GPU, so the `capture_cursor` overlay costs no readback either; the
//! server keeps its own software cursor out of a copy from the screen, so the cursor is never drawn
//! twice.
//!
//! Everything that can be checked is checked before a frame is delivered, and the path is
//! declined otherwise: a codec no hardware engine serves, software encoding, a server without
//! DRI3 1.2, Damage or Render, a server drawing on a device other than the encode node, a buffer
//! the server will not import, or a first frame the encoder cannot read. A watermark is not among
//! them: it is composited by the server through Render, as the cursor is. The capture then runs the XShm path with nothing half-built.
